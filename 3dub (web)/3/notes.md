## Site layout  
### Home page  
First page has a link to the secrets page, two text fields for a username and a password, and a button that says log in or create user  

### Secrets  
The secrets page lists the name of the secret along with the owner (username) and a link to show the secret.  

### Show  
This page shows the naem of the secret and the secret itself.  

## Notes  
A lot of the secrets cause a sinatra stack trace when you click the show link.  Haven't narrowed down which field (username, password, secret name, secret) is causing the show page to crash.  

A copy of the secrets page at the time of testing and a copy of the stack trace are saved in the chromium_saved directory.
